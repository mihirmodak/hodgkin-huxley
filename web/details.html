                This project was originally a lab assignment in a physiology course at the University of Maryland. It involved 
                implementing the <em>Hodgkin-Huxley Model</em> in MATLAB, figuring out the relevant thresholds to manipulate 
                the neuron's state, and changing the parameters to cause a 'disease' state (a state wildly different from the 
                normal activity of the neuron).

            <p>
                The <em>Hodgkin-Huxley Model</em> is a mathematical model of a human neuron that can mimic the electrical 
                voltage across a neuron's membrane by tracking multiple parameters about the neuron's state and environment.
                <br/><br/>

                Human neurons (or really, any neurons) have one very important property that lets them transmit information
                through electric impulses along the length of their cell body. Neurons can generate 
                <strong>action potentials (APs)</strong>, which are giant upward (positive) spikes in the voltage across
                the cell membrane. 
                <br/><br/>

                Neurons can generate these because they have ion channels in their membrane. They can passively increase
                the voltage across their cell membrane (membrane voltage or \(V_m\)) until a certain threshold. Once the 
                threshold is reached, a whole bunch of gates open up for ions to flow freely. And that causes the giant 
                spike that you see in the image below.
                <br/><br/>

                A detailed description of how the model works and the parameters it tracks can be found in the 'Conceptual 
                Summary' section of 
                <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~wjh/hh_model_intro/">this article</a>.

                Those values can be plugged into the Hodgkin-Huxley model equation as the initial state of the neuron, along with 
                the conductances of each ion/channel (\(g_{Na}\), \(g_{K}\), \(g_{L}\))

                \[ 
                
                    {dV_m \over dt} = { - g_K (V_m - E_K) - g_{Na} (V_m - E_{Na}) - g_L (V_m - E_L) + I_{stim} \over {C_m} }
                
                \]

                This model considers the movement of two ions &#8212; Sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) and Potassium (K<sup>+</sup>). Each 
                ion has its own channels, and each of those is controlled by <strong>gating parameters</strong>. See 
                the Conceptual Summary in <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~wjh/hh_model_intro/">this</a> article for a more 
                complete and detailed explanation. 
                The Na<sup>+</sup> conductance through the ion channels is controlled by two gating parameters, 
                (<b>m</b> and <b>h</b>) while the K<sup>+</sup> conductance is governed by the 
                <b>n</b> gating parameter.
                <br/><br/>

                The \(I_{stim}\) variable accounts for the current that we 'manually' inject into the neuron. Any current we 
                inject does affect the membrane potential. Including \(I_{stim}\) in the equation allows our simulated neuron 
                to respond to simulated external stimuli.
                
            </p>

            <!-- Potassium Model -->
            <h3>The Potassium Model</h3>
            <p>
                The conductance of Potassium ions is given by
                \[
                    { g_K (t, v_m) } = { \overline{g_K} \times n^4(t, v_m)}
                \]
                
                This equation is dependent on the gating parameter <b>n</b>, and we can model the change in <b>n</b> over time 
                using a differential equation.
                
                \[
                    {dn \over dt} = { \alpha_n v_m (1-n)\ -\ \beta_n v_m n }
                \]

                where \(\alpha_n\) and \(\beta_n\) are coefficients calculated using the potential difference 
                \(v_m = V_m - V_r\). This \(v_m\) (lowercase as opposed to  \(V_m\) ) is the difference between the current state
                of a neuron and the initial resting state.
            </p>

            <!-- Sodium Model -->
            <h3>The Sodium Model</h3>
            <p>
                Similar to the Potassium Model, the conductance of sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) ions is given by

                \[
                    { g_{Na} (t, v_m) } = { \overline{g_K} \times m^3 (t, v_m) \times h (t, v_m)}
                \]

                There are two gating parameters here &#8212; <b>m</b> and <b>h</b> &#8212; and we can model the rate of change of 
                those parameters using their own differential equations.

                    \[
                    {dm \over dt} = { \alpha_m (1 - m) - \beta_m \ m }
                    \]

                    \[
                    {dh \over dt} = { \alpha_h (1 - h) - \beta_h \ h }
                    \]

                Here, the \(\alpha\)s and \(\beta\)s are coefficients that care calculated using the membrane voltage 
                \(v_m = V_m - V_r\)
            </p>

            <h3>Implementation</h3>

            <p>
                We implemented the Hodgkin-Huxley model in MATLAB using the <code>ode45</code> command. Our implementation 
                involved creating multiple components to simulate and visualize the changing membrane voltages based on the 
                model's principles. Firstly, we collectively worked on a function file called <code>hh_model.m</code>, which 
                contained the differential equations governing the model. This single function takes care of running the ode45 
                function and updating all the model parameters.
                <br/><br/>
                Additionally, we developed another function file called <code>RepetitiveStimulator.m</code>, which determined 
                the stimulation at any given time. This function takes into account properties such as duration, magnitude, and 
                timing to calculate the stimulation magnitude.
                <br/><br/>
                In the main code file, named <code>main.m</code>, we brought together our individual contributions. We called the 
                <code>ode45</code> function to simulate the changing membrane voltage, setting up parameters such as simulation 
                duration, time step, and initial membrane voltage. We also formulated a loop that iterated over each time step, 
                calling <code>ode45</code> and incorporating the stimulation determined by the <code>stimulation.m</code> 
                function.
                <br/><br/>
                Finally, we used the <code>plot</code> function to visualize the membrane voltage output. By plotting the voltage 
                against time, we were able to observe the simulation results and analyze the behavior of the Hodgkin-Huxley model.

            <p>With this implementation of the Hodgkin-Huxley Model, we tried to answer 4 different questions about the simulated neuron.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>What is the resting membrane potential of the simulated neuron?</li>
                <li>What is the actional potential threshold of the neuron? In other words, what membrane voltage needs to be reached to generate an action potential?</li>
                <li>What heppens when we stimulate the neuron using a hyperpolarizing impulse instead of a depolarizing impulse?</li>
                <li>How long is the absolute and relative refractory period of the simulated neruon? Or, what is the minimum time between two action potentials?</li>
                <li>How much of an effect does the initial membrance potential have on the activity of the neuron? Does this resemble any disease states?</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Finding the Resting Membrane Potential</h3>
            <p>
                First, we ran the model without providing any stimuli. This gave us a steady plot with the membrane voltage while 
                the neuron is at rest. By definition, that magnitude is the resting membrane potential (RMP) of the simulated 
                neuron.

            <h3>Generating a Single Action Potential</h3>
            <p>Through trial and error, starting from the resting membrane potential, we found that the neuron's threshold was 
                around -67 mV. This means that a minimum stimulus current of approximately 79 nA was needed to trigger an action 
                potential.</p>

            <h3>Generating a Hyperpolarized Action Potential</h3>
            <p>
                The threshold for a hyperpolarizing stimulus is the voltage value at which the 'rebound depolarization' exceeds 
                the depolarization threshold found above in part 1. This value is more negative than the resting membrane 
                potential, since a hyperpolarizing stimulus lowers the voltage across the membrane. Through trial and error, we 
                found that the hyperpolarization threshold is around -81.1 mV, corresponding to a -71nA current.

            <h3>Measuring the Refractory Period</h3>
            <p>
                We then wanted to find out how quickly our neuron can recover from firing an action potential. Or, how quickly 
                can our neuron fire a second AP after already firing once? We provided multiple stimuli to the neuron with 
                varying time separation between the stimuli (the magnitude of the stimuli was constant for a single simulation 
                run). Using the data collected from all the runs, we created the plot below. 
                <br/><br/>
                The absolute refractory period of the neuron was around 4.53 ms, where it would take a large stimulus (larger 
                than 450 nA) to fire another AP. The relative refractory period lasted approximately 30 ms, until the current 
                required became more stable between 50 nA and 100 nA.

            <h3>Impact of the Membrane Potential</h3>
            <p>
                We finally decided to change the RMP value from the biologically standard -72 mV. First, we set the RMP to 
                -90 mV, more negative than the biologically observed value of -72 mV. In this case, applying a single stimulus at 
                1.0 ms causes a cascade of sequential action potentials, seemingly without end.
            </p>
            <img src="web-resources/results/4 Disease State -90.jpg">
            <p>
                Meanwhile, setting the Vr value to -50 mV (more positive than the biologically observed value) results in a 
                single action potential from a single stimulus. This behavior is the same as the neuronal behavior seen before, 
                in non-disease states. However, it should be noted that rate of change in membrane voltage and in gating 
                parameter values is dependent on the magnitude of the stimulus. Larger stimuli cause faster changes in these 
                values as seen here.

        <h2>Conclusions</h2>
        <p>
            The Hodgkin-Huxley model seems to stimulate the behavior of neurons in response to depolarizing stimuli relatively 
            accurately. The positive stimulus makes the membrane potential less negative, which in turn causes an increase in the 
            activation parameter m and the parameter n. This also causes a corresponding decrease in the deactivation parameter 
            h. All these changes combined lead to the generation of an action potential.
            <br/><br/>
            However, the hyperpolarization modeling could be improved. Hyperpolarization causes h (the inactivation parameter) to 
            increase while the conductance of Na and K remains relatively small (decreasing during the stimulus). After the 
            stimulus, the m parameter is the first to respond, increasing very quickly. When resting potential is reached, h has 
            not had enough time to decrease to its normal value during rest. The result is that increased sodium current to the 
            inside of the neuron causes depolarization and therefore an action potential.
            <br/><br/>
            The absolute refractory period found using this H-H model seem to be slightly inaccurate. For the given conditions 
            in this model, the absolute refractory period found at 4.53 milliseconds is close but outside the range of 
            experimental values (0.4 - 2 ms) However, the fact that this absolute refractory period can be seen in the model 
            shows that the H-H model is a reasonably accurate simulation of electrical conduction in neurons.
            <br/><br/>
            The relative refractory period is due to the hyperpolarization of a neuron after an action potential. We can see in 
            the model that it takes a larger than threshold stimulus to generate another action potential, and that the peak of 
            this second action potential is lower in amplitude than the first. This aligns with the observed experimental 
            behavior of neurons within the refractory period.
